# Product-Management-System

## Node  & mySQL product ordering and management program

## Description

This node.js mySQL program simulates a retailer ordering and product management system leveraging mySQL database as backend product database.  Node inquirer command line prompts which allow for simulation of customer ordering, inventory and sales reporting functions.  

### Database Model

1. Database model consists of department, product and product_order entities 

   - a department has 0 to many products
   - a product has 1 department
   - in this simulation product_order has 1 product per row (if more realistic there would be an order header and order line item  to support a many to many relationship between orders and products)
   - data model is normalized

2. Table Design

   - surrogate keys using identity columns are the primary keys for the tables:  department_id, product_id and product_order_id.  Using surrogate keys can have advantages such as ease and speed of tables joins, key permanence allowing alternate key or natural key to change, migration of keys to linkage/junction tables when many to many relationships become necessary (for exanple:  orders to items yielding an item-order linkage table) 

   - item_code has been added to the product table as it is common to have an alterate key for ordering that in some instances can have business intellegence encoded (item code ranges for instance).  item code has a unique index (UK)
   
     ```mysql
     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX UX1_product_item_code
         ON product (item_code);
     ```
   
   - Normally an order code key would have an internal assignment module, but for the scope of this project the user will be responsible for entering unique item codes when adding new products to the system.
   
   - product_sales on the product table has a default value of 0
   
   - department_name on department table is the alternate/natural key.  When adding a new department the user must choose a unique name, i.e. department_name has a unique index (UK)
   
     ```mysql
     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX UX1_department_department_name
         ON department (department_name);
     ```
   
3. Relationships

   - product table has a foreign key: department_id (FK) to relate it to the department table

     ```mysql
     ALTER TABLE product
     ADD CONSTRAINT FK_product_department
     FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(department_id);
     ```

   - product_order table has a foreign key: product_id (FK) to relate it to the product table

     ```mysql
     ALTER TABLE product_order
     ADD CONSTRAINT FK_product_order_product
     FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(product_id);
     ```

     

### System Functions

1. Customer

   - module allows user to place order by entering item code & quantity
     - item code is validated to ensure it exists and ordered quantity is checked against on-hand quantity
     - following successful order the on-hand qty is decremented and user is shown order detail recap

2. Manager

   - module allows user to perform multiple functions:
     1. view list of products for sale
     2. view list of products with low inventory
     3. add inventory to an item - enter item code and quantity; item code is validated to ensure it exists
        - on hand quantity in incremented and report of updated item is shown
     4. add new product - user enters attributes for a new item
        - item code is validated - it must be unique;  after successful entry report of new item is shown
     5. view product orders by date range
        - start and end dates must be valid - format YYYY-MM-DD
        - list of orders shown that occured between the start and end dates inclusive

3. Supervisor

   - module allows user to:

     1. view product sales and profit grouped by department
     2. add new department - user enters attributes for new department

     - department name is validated - must be unique; after successful entry report of new department is shown
